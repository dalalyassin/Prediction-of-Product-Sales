# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

# About
 - This project focuses on predicting product sales and prices.

# What I Did:
- Understood Business Needs: Identified key factors affecting sales and prices.

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

- Exploratory Analysis: Created visualizations to understand patterns.
  
- Machine Learning Preparation
   - Separated features into nominal, ordinal, and numerical categories.
   - Applied appropriate imputation strategies for missing values in each feature type.
   - Built pipelines to preprocess the data effectively, including encoding and scaling.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Trained machine learning models on the training data and evaluated them using testing data to check accuracy and generalization.
  
# Tools and Libraries Used
 - Python: For overall programming and analysis.
 - Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
 - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
 - Scikit-Learn: For preprocessing, building pipelines, and implementing machine learning models
